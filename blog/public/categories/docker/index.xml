      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Docker for AWS (D4AWS) ever since I was accepted into the public beta, and have been running it in production for a while. One of the best features of D4AWS is that you can deploy it without needing any client-side tooling, due to its use of AWS CloudFormation (CFN).
This simplicity can also be a problem, since CloudFormation can be quite inflexible. In the early days, if you wanted to add a D4AWS stack to an existing VPC, for example, you were out of luck.</description>

      <title>About gomplate</title>

      <description>I released gomplate version 1.6.0 (here) a couple weeks ago. It was a fairly big release, as these things go, but I realized that I haven&amp;rsquo;t ever really introduced gomplate formally. So this post is an attempt to describe what it is, why I thought it needed to exist, and what&amp;rsquo;s happened with it over the last year and a half.
And now, some history&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of Docker, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been using it for a few years, and trying to wrap most programs I use as Docker images.</description>

      <title>Getting YubiKey working with Docker Content Trust on OS X</title>

      <description>Getting YubiKey working with Docker Content Trust on OS X This wasn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked, so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting this here.
First, some super-useful sources:
 Diogo MÃ³nica&amp;rsquo;s blog posting from DockerCon EU 2015 (DOCKER CONTENT TRUST GETS HARDWARE SIGNING) docker/notary#779 (Improve docs for typical CI usage with docker+notary) The YubiKey PIV CLI tool v1.4.3 zip docker/toolbox#461 (from here I gleaned that /usr/local/docker/lib is understood by notary)  I only figured this out because the folks above did most of the work!</description>
