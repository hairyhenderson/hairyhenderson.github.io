      <description>A while back, GitHub announced support for GPG signature verification. Now, git has supported signing commits and tags for a while, but it was a pain to manually verify signed commits, so I&amp;rsquo;m not sure the average developer even considered it.
I saw the announcement, and messed around with it for a few minutes then forgot about it, because I don&amp;rsquo;t use GPG very often, and it hadn&amp;rsquo;t yet clicked that Keybase is really just a GPG management tool&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>Getting YubiKey working with Docker Content Trust on OS X This wasn&amp;rsquo;t as straightforward as I would&amp;rsquo;ve liked, so I&amp;rsquo;m documenting this here.
First, some super-useful sources:
 Diogo MÃ³nica&amp;rsquo;s blog posting from DockerCon EU 2015 (DOCKER CONTENT TRUST GETS HARDWARE SIGNING) docker/notary#779 (Improve docs for typical CI usage with docker+notary) The YubiKey PIV CLI tool v1.4.3 zip docker/toolbox#461 (from here I gleaned that /usr/local/docker/lib is understood by notary)  I only figured this out because the folks above did most of the work!</description>
