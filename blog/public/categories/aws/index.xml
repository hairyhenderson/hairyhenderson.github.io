      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been using Docker for AWS (D4AWS) ever since I was accepted into the public beta, and have been running it in production for a while. One of the best features of D4AWS is that you can deploy it without needing any client-side tooling, due to its use of AWS CloudFormation (CFN).
This simplicity can also be a problem, since CloudFormation can be quite inflexible. In the early days, if you wanted to add a D4AWS stack to an existing VPC, for example, you were out of luck.</description>
